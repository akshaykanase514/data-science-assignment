        "What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to design software in a way that models real-world entities and their interactions. OOP is based on the concept of \"objects,\" which are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior. The key principles of OOP include:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: This involves bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions or procedures) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. Encapsulation helps in hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only what is necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: This allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (base class or superclass). Inheritance promotes code reuse and the creation of a hierarchy of classes, facilitating the organization of code in a more structured manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: This refers to the ability of objects to take on multiple forms. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class, and it enables code to work with objects in a more generic way.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction: Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential features relevant to the program. It allows developers to focus on the necessary details while ignoring irrelevant complexities."

        " The self parameter in class methods serves as a reference to the instance of the class upon which the method is called. This convention allows the method to access and manipulate the unique attributes and methods of the instance. By using self, the method gains the ability to interact with instance variables, class variables, and other methods associated with the instance. It is essentially a way to distinguish instance-specific data and behaviors within the class. The self parameter plays a crucial role in encapsulating the functionality of objects and promoting the principles of object-oriented programming by ensuring that methods operate on the correct instance of the class. While other names could technically be used in place of self, adhering to this convention enhances code clarity and maintains consistency across Python classes."
